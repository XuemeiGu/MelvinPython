# Overview

Here are the mathematica version of Melvin written by [Mario Krenn](https://mariokrenn.wordpress.com/)

## Codes

Examples on creating quantum physical states and symbolic transformations:

* The SimpleHOMExample program shows how to work with quantum states, and how the symbolic transformations work.
```
    SimpleHOMExample.nb 
```
* The CalcSRV program is a full version which searches for 3-particle high-dimensionally entanged states with existing optical elements.	
```
    CalcSRV.nb
```

* I just add one more very simple code -- Calc4ParticleSRV, for checking what is the SchmidtRankVector of a given maximally quantum state (I only consider cases in the same coefficient). 
```
    Calc4ParticleSRV.nb
```
